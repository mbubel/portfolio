        <p>Hello! My name is Michael Bubel, and I was born February 25th, 1989. Growing up in El Cajon, a majority of my
          childhood was spent outside, skateboarding with my friends. Growing up in Rancho San Diego was awesome. It
          wasn't your typical, "Small town", but it had that kind of vibe when I was a child. All the schools I went to,
          from daycare all the way up to college, are within about two miles of each other! I graduated from Steele
          Canyon High School in 2007, and moved on to Grossmont/Cuyamaca Community College. After a few semesters of
          college, I decided I wasn't too interested in continuing school and started working full time. Eventually I
          landed a job at a tech company (where I currently work) working in their warehouse department. </p>
        <p> <img src="./assets/images/buddies.jpg" class="card-img-top buddies" alt="Beers and Ballast Point" /> Outside
          of
          work, you can probably catch me at a local camping site, playing video games, video editing, or at a local
          bar/restaurant!</p>
        <p> I currently am living in Hillcrest with my lovely girlfriend, Aubrey, and our menagerie! We have a pretty
          large fur family, which consists of three cats named Zero, Gambit, and Rogue. We also have a rambunctious
          English Mastiff named Bear! She is such a good girl, who loves tummy pats, being in the way, and
          <em>getting</em> her way!</p>
